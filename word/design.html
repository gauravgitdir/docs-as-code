    <h1>Design</h1>

    <p>
      This document describes the design of the Docs as Code workflow for this project.
      It explains how documentation is authored, stored, validated, and published alongside
      application code.
    </p>

    <h2>Downloading</h2>

    <p>
      This section describes how the rendered design document is downloaded or accessed by users.
      In most cases, the generated HTML or site is exposed via a static site host, artifact
      repository, or internal portal.
    </p>

    <h2>Architecture</h2>

    <p>The Docs as Code pipeline consists of the following components:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Git repository that stores Markdown, configuration, and assets.</li>
      <li>Continuous integration pipeline that runs linting and tests on every change.</li>
      <li>
        Static site generator or build step that converts Markdown into HTML or another output
        format.
      </li>
      <li>Deployment step that publishes the generated output to a documentation endpoint.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Developers and writers work in feature branches, open merge requests, and rely on code review
      to validate both code and documentation changes before merging.
    </p>

    <h2>Authoring workflow</h2>

    <p>
      Documentation is written in Markdown using a lightweight style guide and linting rules.
      Contributors use their preferred editor or IDE with Markdown support, preview the content
      locally, and then commit changes.
    </p>

    <p>On every pushed branch, the CI pipeline:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Runs the Markdown linter to catch style and formatting issues.</li>
      <li>Optionally runs link checkers or custom validation steps.</li>
      <li>Produces preview artifacts so reviewers can see the rendered documentation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Publishing</h2>

    <p>When changes are merged into the main branch, the pipeline:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Regenerates the full documentation site from the Markdown files.</li>
      <li>Publishes the output to the configured hosting environment.</li>
      <li>
        Optionally tags the repository or updates release notes to link to the new documentation.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This approach ensures that documentation updates follow the same lifecycle as code changes
      and are always deployed in a consistent, repeatable way.
    </p>

    <h2>Future enhancements</h2>

    <p>Potential future enhancements to this design include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Adding diagrams defined as code and storing them with the Markdown sources.</li>
      <li>Integrating search and navigation improvements into the generated site.</li>
      <li>Enforcing stricter rules for link checking and content completeness.</li>
      <li>Providing templates for new documents to standardize structure and tone.</li>
    </ul>
